- `expo-media-library@~17.0.7` - Media management
- `socket.io-client@^4.7.5` - Real-time communication

### 2. Configure Appwrite

You need to create 3 new collections in your Appwrite console:

#### Create Collections:

1. **Go to Appwrite Console** → Your Database → Create Collection

2. **Collection 1: Live Streams**
   - Name: `Live Streams`
   - Copy the Collection ID and replace `livestreams_collection_id` in `lib/appwrite.js`
   - Add attributes (see detailed guide in `LIVE_STREAMING_SETUP.md`)

3. **Collection 2: Live Comments**
   - Name: `Live Comments`
   - Copy the Collection ID and replace `livecomments_collection_id` in `lib/appwrite.js`
   - Add attributes (see detailed guide in `LIVE_STREAMING_SETUP.md`)

4. **Collection 3: Live Reactions**
   - Name: `Live Reactions`
   - Copy the Collection ID and replace `livereactions_collection_id` in `lib/appwrite.js`
   - Add attributes (see detailed guide in `LIVE_STREAMING_SETUP.md`)

### 3. Update Collection IDs

Open `lib/appwrite.js` and replace the placeholder IDs:

```javascript
liveStreamsCollectionId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_COLLECTION_ID",
liveCommentsCollectionId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_COLLECTION_ID",
liveReactionsCollectionId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_COLLECTION_ID",
```

### 4. Build and Run

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Video Streaming

The current implementation provides **UI and database infrastructure** for live streaming. For actual real-time video streaming, you'll need to integrate one of these services:

**Recommended Services:**
- **Agora.io** - Excellent for React Native
- **AWS IVS** - Scalable and reliable
- **Twilio Video** - Easy integration
- **100ms** - Modern solution with good documentation
- **Mux Live** - Simple and effective

**Integration Point:** 
The video URL integration point is in `components/LiveStreamPlayer.jsx` (line ~104)

### Real-Time Features

Currently uses **Appwrite Realtime** for:
- Live comments
- Viewer count updates
- Stream status changes

### Permissions

Already configured for:
- ✅ Camera access (iOS & Android)
- ✅ Microphone access (iOS & Android)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Permission Issues
```bash
# For Android, ensure permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
# For iOS, check Info.plist entries
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

### Appwrite Connection Issues
- Verify collection IDs are correct
- Check database permissions (Read/Write for users)
- Ensure Realtime is enabled in Appwrite

## 📚 Documentation

- **Detailed Setup**: `LIVE_STREAMING_SETUP.md`
- **Expo Camera**: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/
- **Appwrite Realtime**: https://appwrite.io/docs/realtime

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up Appwrite collections** (most important!)
2. **Test the flow** on a device (camera requires physical device)
3. **Choose a video streaming service** for production
4. **Customize UI** to match your brand
5. **Add notifications** for followers when someone goes live

## 🚀 Ready to Go Live!

After completing the Appwrite setup, you're ready to test the live streaming feature. The UI is fully functional and ready for integration with a real video streaming service.
